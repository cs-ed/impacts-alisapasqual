# Impacts on Society

Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level. Broadly explain how this document details how you plan to incorporate issues of computing impacts on society in your course

Course Name: Computer Science Essentials

Description: Computer Science Essentials is an introductory course into computer science. This course introduces students to the basics of computer programming by using a block-based programming language (Scratch). As students progress through the course, they will transition to a text-based programming language that displays block and text programming side-by-side (Python). Both positive and harmful impacts of computer science on society will be discussed during this class with a reflection done at the end of each project.

Grade Level: 9th

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to identify both positive and harmful impacts that their computer science projects can have on society.

Students will be able to evaluate and critique other classmates' projects on their impacts to society.

Students will discuss positive and harmful impacts that computer science as a whole can have on society.

### Learning Activities

Class Discussion: On the first day of class, students will be asked to reflect on the following two questions:
1. How has computer science created a positive impact on society?
2. How has computer science created a harmful impact on society?
Students will then have a discussion within their table group of 4 students about their answers and then one student will be the spokesperson to share out their team's findings to the whole class.

Projects:
The course will go through various projects throughout the semesters using Google for Education CS First's Curriculum (https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/c/cs-first/en/curriculum.html). As a reflection paper for the end of each project, students will be asked to reflect on the same two questions above in regards to their personal project:
1. How could YOUR computer science project create a positive impact on society?
2. How could YOUR computer science project create a harmful impact on society?

At the end of each project, students will also do a gallery walk so that they can see other students' projects and learn from them. Each student will have sticky notes as they walk around to see the different projects to write down how they could envision their classmates' projects creating a positive impact on society or ways that they could improve the project.

### Assessment

The projects will be graded on a pre-determined rubric scale from 1-4 (Beginning, Developing, Accomplished, and Exemplary) for each category.
while the gallery walk will be graded on participation.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
